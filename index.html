	<p>Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania. Swift spent her early years with her parents, Scott and Andrea, and brother, Austin, on the family‚Äôs Christmas tree farm in nearby Wyomissing. ‚ÄúI had the most magical childhood, running free and going anywhere I wanted to in my head,‚Äù she told Rolling Stone. She learned to ride horses and even competed for a time, but a greater passion soon took root. (<cite><a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/taylor-swift#who-is-taylor-swift">source</a></cite>)</p>

<p>Swift followed in the musical footsteps of her grandmother Marjorie Finlay, who was a professional opera singer. By age 10, Swift was singing at a variety of local events, including fairs and contests. She sang ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner‚Äù at a Philadelphia 76ers basketball game at age 11 and began writing her own songs and learning guitar at 12 years old. Her early music idols included Shania Twain and The Chicks. (<cite><a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/taylor-swift#who-is-taylor-swift">source</a></cite>)</p>

<p>To pursue her music career, Swift often visited Nashville, Tennessee, the country music capital. There, she cowrote songs and tried to land a recording contract. Noting her dedication, her family moved to nearby Hendersonville when she was 13 in an attempt to further young Swift‚Äôs career. She attended Hendersonville High School before finishing out her education through the home schooling program of Aaron Academy, a private Christian school, once her musical career took off.

She also holds nine No. 1 Hot Country Songs, including ‚ÄúOur Song‚Äù and ‚ÄúShould‚Äôve Said No.‚Äù(<cite><a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/taylor-swift#who-is-taylor-swift">source</a></cite>)</p>
